# On a sunny summer day, youâ€™ve gone to the park with your friends. 
# After the picnic is eaten, you decide to enjoy the weather by playing 
# a nice game of chaos tag. For those uninitiated in the joys of chaos 
# tag, you explain the following rules:

# 1. Any group of two or more people can play. 
#    All players are active at the start of the game.
# 2. Active players can run around and tag other active players.
# 3. A player who is tagged becomes inactive and must sit on the spot where they were tagged.
# 4. An inactive player becomes active again when the player who tagged them is tagged.
# 5. Victory is achieved by being the only remaining active player.

# Suppose N of you are at the park that day. 
# If all active players are equally likely to 
# tag someone and any of the possible targets 
# are equally likely to be tagged, how long will 
# the game last on average, as measured in tags? 

# (For example, with two players, the game always ends in one tag; 
# with three players, the expected length of the game is three tags.)
