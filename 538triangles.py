Solution to the Riddler Classic problem here: 
https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-you-be-a-ghostbuster-or-a-world-destroyer/

These problems are pretty straightforward once we realize that, 
given stick lengths {a, b, c}, where a < b < c:
	I.  a, b, c can form a triangle iff a+b > c
	II. a, b, c can form an acute triangle iff a**2 + b**2 > c**2
	
We can use Monte Carlo simulations to get approximate answers to the questions:
	1. 50.00%
	2. 25.00%
	3.  7.95%
	4. 21.46%
And our work here is DONE. Code below!"""
