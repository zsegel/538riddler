# You and your two older siblings are sharing two extra-large 
# pizzas and decide to cut them in an unusual way. You overlap 
# the pizzas so that the crust of one touches the center of the 
# other (and vice versa since they are the same size). You then 
# slice both pizzas around the area of overlap. Two of you will 
# each get one of the crescent-shaped pieces, and the third will 
# get both of the football-shaped cutouts.

# Which should you choose to get more pizza: one crescent or two footballs?

# Here's a Monte Carlo approach to calculating the areas.
# I've assumed that the radius of each pizza is 1.
# One pizza's center is at the origin. the other pizza's
# center is at (1, 0).

# Equation for pizza at the origin: 1 = x^2 + y^2
# Equation for pizza centered at (1, 0): 1 = (x-1)^2 + y^2
