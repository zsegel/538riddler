Solution to Riddler Classic problem found here:

Consider a standard, two-player, 52-card game of War. If I start 
with just the four aces, and you start with all 48 other cards, 
randomly shuffled, what are your chances of winning?

The code below models the game as specified here: http://www.bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/war/
Any cards a player wins are added to the bottom of that player's pile in a random order."""

import numpy as np
from collections import deque

    """returns True if the player who doesn't start with the aces wins"""
    
    # starting cards
    A = deque([14, 14, 14, 14])
    B = deque(range(2,14) * 4)
    np.random.shuffle(B)
    
    while len(A) and len(B):
        cards = [A.popleft(), B.popleft()]
        war = []

        while (cards[0] == cards[1]):
            war.extend(cards[:])
            try:
                war.extend([A.popleft(), B.popleft()])
                cards = [A.popleft(), B.popleft()]
            except:
                return bool(len(B))

            cards.extend(war)
            np.random.shuffle(cards)
