        """Our goal is to find an enemy distribution that requires the greatest minimum 
        number of soldiers to defeat.
        
        This function takes an enemy distribution and then futzes with it randomly to see 
        if an enemy distribution similar to it requires more soldiers to defeat. If it 
        finds one, it starts futzing with THAT distribution, etc.
        
        Technically speaking, this is a very clunky form of stochastic optimization. 
        We're trying to find the maximum of the min_soldiers_needed function.
        
        There's an optional 'anneal' argument. If anneal is True, the function does
        something that I believe counts as 'simulated annealing'. Basically, it futzes 
        with the distribution it's testing A LOT at first, and that futzing cools down
        gradually over time. Annealing usually speeds up the algorithm and reduces the
        chance that it will get stuck in a local maximum.
        
        Args:
            dist (list): The distribution you start futzing with (10 ints).
            n (int): The number of times you futz.
            depth (int greater than 1): The amount of futziness per futz.
            anneal: if True, does simulated annealing (you should make depth 10 or more)

            int: Greatest output value of the min_soldiers_needed function that it found.
